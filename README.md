# Introduction

This is a simple for fun project with the main purpose was to learn about this new exciting React Server Component and Server Actions. I am happy to report that developer's experience wise, it felt incredible. However, this was just a simple project I wanted to set up to learn both React 18, Nextjs 13 and Typescript at the same time. I may potentially start adding more functionality to this, but I think for me, it has fulfilled its purpose. Thank you

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
